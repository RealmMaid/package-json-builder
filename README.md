ðŸ“¦ Package.json Builder
A friendly desktop application designed to make life easier for developers by simplifying the creation, management, and publishing of package.json files. Built with love and Electron!

âœ¨ Features
GUI for package.json: Easily create and edit your package.json file without manually typing everything.

NPM Integration: Fetch your own public packages or search for any package on NPM to add to your project.

Direct Publishing: Select a local package folder and publish it directly to the NPM registry from within the app.

Smart Compatibility Checker: Automatically checks for peerDependency conflicts between the packages you've selected, helping you avoid broken installs before they happen!
