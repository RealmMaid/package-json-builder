A friendly desktop application designed to make life easier for developers by simplifying the creation, management, and publishing of `package.json` files. Built with love and Electron! ðŸ’–

## âœ¨ Features

* **GUI for `package.json`:** Easily create and edit your `package.json` file without manually typing everything.
* **NPM Integration:** Fetch your own public packages or search for any package on NPM to add to your project.
* **Direct Publishing:** Select a local package folder and publish it directly to the NPM registry from within the app.
* **Smart Compatibility Checker:** Automatically checks for `peerDependency` conflicts between the packages you've selected, helping you avoid broken installs before they happen!

## ðŸš€ Building From Source

Want to build the app yourself? It's easy! Just follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

First, make sure you have these tools installed on your computer.
* **Node.js**: [Download here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v18 or newer is recommended).
* **Yarn**: After installing Node.js, you can install Yarn by running this command in your terminal:
    ```sh
    npm install -g yarn
    ```
* **Git**: [Download here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Installation & Building

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run this command to download the project files.
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/package-builder-app.git](https://github.com/your-username/package-builder-app.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Folder:**
    ```sh
    cd package-builder-app
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This command will download all the necessary packages for the app.
    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```

4.  **Run the App (Development Mode):**
    If you want to run the app to test it without building an installer, use this command.
    ```sh
    yarn start
    ```

5.  **Build the Installer:**
    This is the final step! This command will create a distributable installer file (like an `.exe` or `.dmg`) in a new `dist` folder.
    ```sh
    yarn dist
    ```
    *Note: This command will automatically build for the operating system you are currently using (Windows, macOS, or Linux).*
